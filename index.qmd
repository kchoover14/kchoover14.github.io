title: "Kara C. Hoover"
subtitle: "Biological Anthropologist & Data Scientist"
---

I'm a biological anthropologist and data scientist who bridges academic research, policy analysis, and applied analytics. My work spans human biological variation and adaptation -- from biomechanics and genetic epidemiology to olfactory evolution and sensory inequities -- alongside data-driven policy research in international science strategy, global R&D trends, and social equity. I specialize in translating complex data into actionable intelligence through advanced analytics (NLP, machine learning, network analysis), interactive visualizations, and reproducible workflows in R, Python, and SQL.

## Research Areas

**Human Biological Variation & Adaptation**
Bioarchaeology, biomechanics, developmental stress, skeletal morphology, sexual dimorphism, population health across prehistory and the colonial era.

**Olfactory Science & Genetics**
Odorant receptor variation, olfactory ecology, field and lab methods, sensory inequities, and the evolutionary biology of smell in humans and other primates.

**Policy & International Science**
Global R&D trends, science strategy, democracy and governance, women's empowerment, forecasting and policy modelling using large comparative datasets.

**Climate, Health & Adaptation**
Extreme weather impacts, health care access and life expectancy, conservation and conflict, geospatial analysis of human-environment interaction.
