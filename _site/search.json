    "text": "I’m a biological anthropologist and data scientist who bridges academic research, policy analysis, and applied analytics. My work spans human biological variation and adaptation – from biomechanics and genetic epidemiology to olfactory evolution and sensory inequities – alongside data-driven policy research in international science strategy, global R&D trends, and social equity. I specialize in translating complex data into actionable intelligence through advanced analytics (NLP, machine learning, network analysis), interactive visualizations, and reproducible workflows in R, Python, and SQL.\nORCID | Google Scholar | GitHub"
