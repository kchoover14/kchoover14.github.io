    "text": "I’m a biological anthropologist and data scientist with expertise spanning human biological variation, environmental health, and applied data analytics. My career bridges academic research, federal agencies, and industry, where I’ve led technical projects that integrate biological data, policy analysis, and computational methods to address complex questions in public health, international science policy, and social equity.\nMy academic research has examined human adaptation and variation across multiple biological systems – from developmental stress and climate adaptation to biomechanics of the skull and postcranial skeleton, genetic epidemiology of West Nile Virus, and the evolution and ecology of human olfaction. I’m particularly interested in how environmental change shapes human biology and creates health inequities, including Anthropocene-induced sensory inequities.\nThroughout my career, I’ve applied data analytics to diverse questions, from population genetics and biomechanics to policy research and international science strategy. Over the past five years, my analytical focus has shifted toward natural language processing, network analysis, bibliometrics, and predictive modeling for policy applications. My recent work has centered on international science and technology policy, analyzing global R&D trends, research collaboration networks, and the relationship between democracy, education, and governance. I’ve developed interactive applications and analytical pipelines to evaluate program impact, forecast shifts in global research leadership, and examine connections between women’s empowerment and demographic outcomes.\nMy technical toolkit includes R, Python, and SQL for statistical analysis and modeling, with expertise in Bayesian methods, machine learning, geospatial analysis (QGIS, ArcGIS), phylogenetic analysis, text mining and NLP, network analysis, and interactive data visualization using Shiny and Quarto. I use GitHub for version control and collaborative development. I’m experienced in managing large datasets, building ETL pipelines, and developing reproducible analytical workflows that translate complex data into actionable intelligence and compelling visual narratives."
