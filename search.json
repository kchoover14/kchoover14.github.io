My domain expertise in anthropology is human biological and genetic variation and adaptation. My scientific research focuses on developmental instability & health disparity, olfactory science ecology & genetics, and climate health & adaptation. My applied projects focus primarily on social policy, international science, research landscape scoping, and forecasting.
